This project uses a github package called PyBrain

the short installation of this package is:

    git clone git://github.com/pybrain/pybrain.git
    cd pybrain
    python setup.py install
    
There are a few dependencies, but I doubt you don't already have them installed:

Project3.py is the executable python file that meets the project specs
